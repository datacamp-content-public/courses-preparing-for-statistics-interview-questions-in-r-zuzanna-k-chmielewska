In this lesson, we will refresh our memory about ANOVA.
Let’s get started!

## Introduction to ANOVA

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d537e57d75"
```

`@part1`
ANOVA = ANalysis Of VAriance {{1}}

In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a **statistical test** whether the population **means** of several **groups** are **different**. {{2}}

Approaches: {{3}}
- ```oneway.test``` - if the populations have normal distributions, {{3}}
- ```kruskal.test``` - otherwise. {{3}}


`@script`
ANOVA is a powerful statistical technique.
It stands for Analysis of Variance.
There are several various applications of ANOVA. 
In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test whether the population means of several groups are different.
If we know that populations have normal distributions, we can use one-way ANOVA. 
Otherwise, we shall use a nonparametric version of this test, the Kruskal-Wallis test.

## One-way ANOVA - dataset

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "e7b346eb08"
```

`@part1`
Dataset needs to include:
- factor - e.g. race (ogres, dwarfs, goblins),
- numerical variable - e.g. lifespan.


`@part2`
For example:

| race | lifespan | 
|:-:|:-:| 
| goblin | 90 |  
| ogre | 81 | 
| dwarf | 242 |
| ... | ... |


`@script`
Let’s start with one-way ANOVA.
Dataset needs to include one factor and one numerical variable.
In our case, we have got a dataset of creatures’ lifespans split by races (ogres, dwarfs and goblins).
Three first rows of our dataset show a goblin who lived up to 90, ogre who lived up to 80 and a dwarf who lived up to 242 years old.

## One-way ANOVA - hypotheses

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "18229c0d30"
```

`@part1`
**Hypotheses:** {{1}}

H0: m_1 = m_2 = m_3 = ... = m_n {{1}}

H1: means are not all equal {{1}}

**For example:** {{2}}
```r
oneway.test(lifespan ~ race, data = creatures)
``` {{2}}
returns p-value < 2.2e-16. {{2}}

Life expectancies of ogres, goblins and dwarfs are not equal. {{2}}


`@script`
In one-way ANOVA, null hypothesis states that all means are equal.
Alternative hypothesis states that means are not all equal.
The result of our example is p-value close to zero. 
Hence, life expectancies of ogres, goblins and dwarfs are not equal.
The result of ANOVA does not indicate which of the groups are different.
It states that at least one pair of groups differs.
Let’s visualize our data with a boxplot.


---
## One-way ANOVA - test (3 groups)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1ee5f3a808"
```

`@part1`
Test if means across groups are different using ```oneway.test```.

Syntax is ```oneway.test(x ~ f)``` where: 
- x is a numeric variable,
- f is a factor that identifies the groups.

For example: 
```
oneway.test(lifespan ~ race, data = creatures)
```


`@script`
We will test if means of life expectancies across races are different using oneway.test function in R.
The syntax is oneway.test with formula x tilde f, where x is a numerical variable and f is a factor that identifies groups.
In our example it would be oneway.test with formula lifespan explained by race and data equal creatures.
Specifying data is optional.
If we do not specify the data, R will take variables from the global environment.

## One-way ANOVA - boxplot

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c8f54ce0a2"
```

`@part1`
![Lifespan of races visualized with a boxplot](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5061/datasets/f4d0f5fac3c58724949c0ba39100b6571486b26c/boxplot.png = 70)


`@script`
The boxplot shows that dwarfs have a significantly higher median life expectancy than other races. 
Median lifespans of goblins and ogres seem similar.
We can check that by running ANOVA only on these two races.


---
## One-way ANOVA - test (2 groups)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7d26112c91"
```

`@part1`
**For example:**

```
oneway.test(lifespan ~ race, data = creatures, 
	subset = which(creatures$race != "dwarf"))
```
returns p-value = 0.09463.

Fail to reject the null hypothesis for significance level of 5%.


`@script`
If we run ANOVA on a subset of data which excludes dwarfs, the result of the test is a p-value of around 9%.
With conventional significance level of 5%, we fail to reject null hypothesis which states that means are equal.
However, for a significance level of 10% we could not state that.
The outcome of the test depends on the assumed significance level.

## Robust ANOVA – dataset

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a223aeff70"
```

`@part1`
In **Kruskal-Wallis test**, numeric variable does **not** have to be **normally distributed**. 

**Example:** sea cruise ratings by those with weak and strong stomachs.

| rating | stomach |
|:-:|:-:|
| 2 | weak |
| 1 | weak |
| 7 | strong |
| ... | ... |


`@script`
If numerical variable is not from a normal distribution, we can use Kruskal-Wallis test.
This time, our dataset are participants’ ratings of a sea cruise. They have evaluated their experiences on a scale 1 to 10. Participants are split into two groups: those with weak stomach and those with strong stomach.

## Robust ANOVA - plot

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0092013948"
```

`@part1`
![Frequency plot for sea cruise ratings by those with weak and strong stomachs](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5061/datasets/bb4a33991eeebec03251083fba0020cabf4f3b8c/cruise-plot.png)


`@script`
In the upper part of the plot, we see the ratings from participants with strong stomachs. They gave mostly tens and a lot of nines and eights.
Those with weak stomach were not as happy and gave a lot of low ratings.
The distribution of the ratings is not normal hence we will use Kruskal-Wallis test.


---
## Robust ANOVA - test

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2b85e368c9"
```

`@part1`
Syntax is ```kruskal.test(x ~ f)```.

For example: 
```
kruskal.test(rating ~ stomach, data = cruise_ratings)
```
returns p-value < 2.2e-16.

Null hypothesis on equality of medians is rejected.


`@script`
In R, we can use kruskal.test function.
The syntax is similar to oneway.test. It is kruskal.test with formula x tilde f.
We perform the test on sea cruise ratings explained by stomach type.
P-value is close to zero. Hence, we reject null hypothesis in favor of alternative hypothesis that medians differ significantly.
